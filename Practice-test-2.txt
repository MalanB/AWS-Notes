My learnings from Practice test #2
==================================

- Use Direct connect with VPN for better performance
- Lifecycle hooks are for event based trigger. Use scheduled action for time based trigger
- Different object versions can have different retention period
- Versioning cannot be turned off except once
- There is no S3 data transfer charges 
- ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instance and EBS volumes used
- ECS with Fargate launch is charged based on vCPU and memory resources
- For IP address target group we can only use private IP address
- KMS CMK enforces waiting period of 7-30
- Firehose cannot directly write into a DynamoDB table
- Snowball edge can store 80TB data
- API gateway can throttle requests
- Use IAM and SSO for federated access
- Io volumes are better than gp2 volumes
- Cost of EFS < cost of EBS
- Kinesis Firehost = loads data from stream to any data store/ analytics. Ex: to S3
- Kinesis Data Analytics = Analyze streaming data in real time
- Data flow in kinesis
	- Data stream (capture)
	- Analytics   (analyze)
	- Firehost    (store)
